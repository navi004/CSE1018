//to change the datatype
 //Type-casting = Converting one datatype to another
        /*Two types of typecasting - Implicit and Explicit
         * 1.Implicit Typecasting: Converting from a narrower datatype to a wider datatype
         *Datatypes who has higher memory allocation are called wider datatypes
         e.g., When we compare 'long' and 'int', we can say that 'long' is the wider datatype because its memory allocation is 8 bytes.
         'int' is a narrower datatype since its memory allocation is 4 bytes 
          In simple terms, imagine yourself standing in the Trends showroom shopping for T-shirt
         If your T-shirt size is 'S', you can also buy T-shirts of size 'M', 'L', 'XL', etc. 
         You can wear a bigger size T-shirt when you feel sick. This is called implicit casting. 
         byte(S size), short(M size), int(L size), long(XL size) */
